# CONCURRENT PROGRAMMING PROJECT

The project consists of an analysis of the same algorithm (Jacobi Method) in both sequential and parallel implementations.

For this purpose, three files were created:

*jacobi_seq.c
*jacobi_parallel.c
*jacobi_mpi.c

The first file represents the algorithm in a sequential manner. The second file represents the same algorithm, but parallelized using threads. Finally, the third file is also a parallelization, but using message passing based on the MPI protocol.
