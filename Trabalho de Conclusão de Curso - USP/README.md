Programa Nacional de Alimentação Escolar (PNAE) is a public policy based on the distribution of resources to participating entities in order to promote the feeding of students in these institutions. Like many other policies, the PNAE is a program that is difficult to supervise and monitor. The main objective of this work, which extends and utilizes other projects such as the Brazilian Food Composition Table (TACO), is to demonstrate the possibility of using text mining as a monitoring tool for this program based on the Electronic Invoices issued by municipalities regarding the PNAE. The text mining process involves collecting electronic invoices from program transfers, identifying food products in the descriptions of the invoices, and automatically mapping these products to the TACO table to understand how the resources from these transfers are being managed. Thus, an indicator based on heat maps of an example state was constructed, with the proposal to visually monitor whether the resources of the PNAE have been or are being well spent, according to a pre-established scoring metric.
